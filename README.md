This is a quick 1 day project to visualize data extracted from Hastus.

It uses some libs that will soon be published to NPM from https://github.com/bimodata/bimo.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
